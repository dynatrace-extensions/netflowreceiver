# Netflow Receiver

The netflow receiver is capable of listening for [netflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow), [sflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFlow) or [IPFIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Flow_Information_Export) UDP traffic and generating log entries based on the flow content.

This gives Opentelemetry users the capability of monitoring network traffic, and answer questions like:

* Which protocols are passing through the network?
* Which servers and clients are producing the highest amount of traffic?
* What ports are involved in these network calls?
* How many bytes and packets are being sent and received?

The receiver listens for flows and decodes them using the templates that are sent by the flow producers. The data then is converted to JSON and produces structured log records.

## Using the receiver

### Docker

A collector with the receiver can be run with docker:

```bash
# windows
docker run --name otelcol -v ${PWD}/config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml -p 2055:2055/udp dlopes7/otelcol-netflow-receiver

# linux
docker run --name otelcol -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml -p 2055:2055/udp dlopes7/otelcol-netflow-receiver
```

This repo contains an example of a `config.yaml`:

```yaml
receivers:
  netflow:
    hostname: "0.0.0.0"
    scheme: netflow
    port: 2055
    sockets: 16
    workers: 32

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 30 
    timeout: 30s

exporters:
  debug:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: https://<environment>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp
    headers: 
      Authorization: "Api-Token <dynatrace_ingest_logs_token>"

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [netflow]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: debug
```

Will start a collector listening on the port 2055 UDP of the host for netflow data.
You can send demo netflow data to that container with:

```bash
docker run --net="host" dlopes7/netflow-generator -r 10 -t localhost -p 2055
```

### Building a collector


[Build a collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/) with the receiver by using:

Example `builder-config.yaml`:

```yaml
dist:
  name: otelcol-dev
  description: Basic OTel Collector distribution for Developers
  output_path: ./otelcol-dev

exporters:
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/debugexporter v0.116.0
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/exporter/otlphttpexporter v0.116.0

processors:
  - gomod:
      go.opentelemetry.io/collector/processor/batchprocessor v0.116.0

receivers:
  - gomod: github.com/dynatrace-extensions/netflowreceiver v1.3.0
    path: .
```

The collector can be built with:

```bash
go install go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder@latest
builder --config builder-config.yaml 
```

The netflow receiver can listen for [netflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow), [sflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFlow), and [ipfix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Flow_Information_Export) data and convert it to OpenTelemetry logs. The receiver is based on the [goflow2](https://github.com/netsampler/goflow2) project.

This gives OpenTelemetry users the capability of monitoring network traffic, and answer questions like:

* Which protocols are passing through the network?
* Which servers and clients are producing the highest amount of traffic?
* What ports are involved in these network calls?
* How many bytes and packets are being sent and received?

## Getting started

By default the receiver will listen for ipfix and netflow on port `2055`. The receiver can be configured to listen on different ports and protocols.

Example configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  netflow:
    - scheme: netflow
      port: 2055
      sockets: 16
      workers: 32

processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 2000
    timeout: 30s

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [netflow]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: debug
```

We recommend using the batch processor to reduce the number of log requests being sent to the exporter. The batch processor will batch log records together and send them in a single request to the exporter.

You would then configure your network devices to send netflow, sflow, or ipfix data to the Collector on the specified ports.

## Configuration

| Field | Description | Examples | Default |
|-------|-------------|--------| ------- |
| scheme | The type of flow data that to receive | `sflow`, `netflow`, `flow` | `netflow` |
| hostname | The hostname or IP address to bind to | `localhost` | `0.0.0.0` |
| port | The port to bind to | `2055` or `6343` | `2055` |
| sockets | The number of sockets to use | 1 | 1 |
| workers | The number of workers used to decode incoming flow messages | 2 | 2 |
| queue_size | The size of the incoming netflow packets queue | 1000 | 1000000 |

## Data format

The netflow data is standardized for the different schemas and is converted to OpenTelemetry logs following the [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attributes/#server-client-and-shared-network-attributes)

The output will adhere the format:

```json
{
    "destination": {
        "address": "192.168.0.1",
        "port": 22
    },
    "flow": {
        "end": 1731073104662487000,
        "sampler_address": "192.168.0.2",
        "sequence_num": 49,
        "start": 1731073077662487000,
        "time_received": 1731073138662487000,
        "type": "NETFLOW_V5"
    },
    "io": {
        "bytes": 529,
        "packets": 378
    },
    "source": {
        "address": "192.168.0.3",
        "port": 40
    },
    "transport": "TCP",
    "type": "IPv4"
}
```
